# SentinelStack 🛡️  
### Security Log Analysis & Threat Intelligence Automation (Python)

**SentinelStack** is a lightweight security automation toolkit that analyzes server/application logs, flags suspicious activity, enriches suspicious IPs with threat intelligence (Geo/IP/ISP), detects potential brute-force attacks, and generates human-readable incident reports in **TXT, Markdown, and HTML** formats.

Ideal for:
- Security Operations (SecOps)
- SOC Analysts (L1/L2)
- Threat Intelligence & Automation learners
- Students building cybersecurity portfolios
- GRC & Audit support teams (SIEM-lite use cases)
